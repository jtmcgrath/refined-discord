## Why?

Discord is great, but has some bugs and annoyances; their team is tiny for what they've accomplished, so instead of complaining let's create a Chrome plugin which fills in the gaps until they can fix the issues for real!

No guarantees that the fixes will always work - when Discord make updates, this extension may break. If you find any bugs, please open an issue.

## Installation

Refined Discord is currently only available as a Chrome extension.

[Install the Chrome extension via the webstore!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/refined-discord/jaaoemgmljmlgmpailnhdikgbpffhkkd)

## Features

#### Character Count

Discord messages have a 2000 character limit, but there's no way to know you've passed the limit until you click send. Refined Discord adds a character count to the text input, so you can split your message into multiple pieces more easily.

#### Toggle Channels

On smaller screens, the web interface becomes unusable. Refined Discord hides the channels interface, making it togglable via a new link at the top of the list of servers.

#### Hide Members

The members section also takes up a lot of space and breaks the layout on smaller screens. Refined Discord automatically hides the members panel on small screens, both on initial load and when you resize your screen!
